### Leetcode Solutions Repository
Welcome to my Leetcode Solutions repository! This repository is dedicated to solving problems on Leetcode, a popular platform for practicing coding skills. Here, I will store solutions to various challenges across different topics, written in languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, or other relevant programming languages.

### About
This repository serves as a personal collection of solutions to Leetcode exercises, with the goal of improving problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews. Each solution will be clearly documented, and explanations will be provided where necessary. You will find optimized approaches to tackle both basic and advanced problems, including:

- Array & String Manipulation
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs & Trees
- Sorting & Searching
- Mathematical Problems
- Backtracking and more
 
The repository is organized by the problem type or topic, and each solution file is named based on the problem title or ID from Leetcode.
